OMB (OSU Micro-Benchmarks)
--------------------------
The OSU Micro-Benchmarks use the GNU build system. Therefore you can simply
use the following steps to build the MPI benchmarks.

Example:
	./configure CC=/path/to/mpicc CXX=/path/to/mpicxx
	make
	make install

CC and CXX can be set to other wrapper scripts as well to build OpenSHMEM or
UPC++ benchmarks as well.  Based on this setting, configure will detect whether
your library supports MPI-1, MPI-2, MPI-3, OpenSHMEM, and UPC++ to compile the
corresponding benchmarks.  See http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/ to
download the latest version of this package.

This package also distributes UPC put, get, and collective benchmarks.
These are located in the upc subdirectory and can be compiled by the
following:

        upcc upc/osu_upc_memput.c -o upc/osu_upc_memput
        upcc upc/osu_upc_memget.c -o upc/osu_upc_memget

        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_barrier.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c     \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_barrier
        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_broadcast.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c   \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_broadcast
        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_exchange.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c    \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_exchange
        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_gather_all.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c  \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_gather_all
        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_gather.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c      \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_gather
        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_reduce.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c      \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_reduce.c
        upcc upc/osu_upc_all_scatter.c upc/osu_coll.c upc/osu_common.c     \
            -o upc/osu_upc_all_scatter

The MPI Multiple Bandwidth / Message Rate (osu_mbw_mr), OpenSHMEM Put Message
Rate (osu_oshm_put_mr), and OpenSHMEM Atomics (osu_oshm_atomics) tests are
intended to be used with block assigned ranks.  This means that all processes
on the same machine are assigned ranks sequentially.

Rank	Block   Cyclic
----------------------
0	host1	host1
1	host1	host2
2	host1	host1
3	host1	host2
4	host2	host1
5	host2	host2
6	host2	host1
7	host2	host2

If you're using mpirun_rsh the ranks are assigned in the order they are seen in
the hostfile or on the command line.  Please see your process managers'
documentation for information on how to control the distribution of the rank to
host mapping.

Point-to-Point MPI Benchmarks
-----------------------------
osu_latency - Latency Test
    * The latency tests are carried out in a ping-pong fashion. The sender
    * sends a message with a certain data size to the receiver and waits for a
    * reply from the receiver. The receiver receives the message from the sender
    * and sends back a reply with the same data size. Many iterations of this
    * ping-pong test are carried out and average one-way latency numbers are
    * obtained. Blocking version of MPI functions (MPI_Send and MPI_Recv) are
    * used in the tests. This test is available here.

osu_latency_mt - Multi-threaded Latency Test
    * The multi-threaded latency test performs a ping-pong test with a single
    * sender process and multiple threads on the receiving process. In this test
    * the sending process sends a message of a given data size to the receiver
    * and waits for a reply from the receiver process. The receiving process has
    * a variable number of receiving threads (set by default to 2), where each
    * thread calls MPI_Recv and upon receiving a message sends back a response
    * of equal size. Many iterations are performed and the average one-way
    * latency numbers are reported. This test is available here.

osu_bw - Bandwidth Test
    * The bandwidth tests were carried out by having the sender sending out a
    * fixed number (equal to the window size) of back-to-back messages to the
    * receiver and then waiting for a reply from the receiver. The receiver
    * sends the reply only after receiving all these messages. This process is
    * repeated for several iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on
    * the elapsed time (from the time sender sends the first message until the
    * time it receives the reply back from the receiver) and the number of bytes
    * sent by the sender. The objective of this bandwidth test is to determine
    * the maximum sustained date rate that can be achieved at the network level.
    * Thus, non-blocking version of MPI functions (MPI_Isend and MPI_Irecv) were
    * used in the test. This test is available here.

osu_bibw - Bidirectional Bandwidth Test
    * The bidirectional bandwidth test is similar to the bandwidth test, except
    * that both the nodes involved send out a fixed number of back-to-back
    * messages and wait for the reply. This test measures the maximum
    * sustainable aggregate bandwidth by two nodes. This test is available here.

osu_mbw_mr - Multiple Bandwidth / Message Rate Test
    * The multi-pair bandwidth and message rate test evaluates the aggregate
    * uni-directional bandwidth and message rate between multiple pairs of
    * processes. Each of the sending processes sends a fixed number of messages
    * (the window size) back-to-back to the paired receiving process before
    * waiting for a reply from the receiver. This process is repeated for
    * several iterations. The objective of this benchmark is to determine the
    * achieved bandwidth and message rate from one node to another node with a
    * configurable number of processes running on each node. The test is
    * available here.

osu_multi_lat - Multi-pair Latency Test
    * This test is very similar to the latency test. However, at the same
    * instant multiple pairs are performing the same test simultaneously.
    * In order to perform the test across just two nodes the hostnames must
    * be specified in block fashion.

Collective Latency Tests
    * The latest OMB version includes benchmarks for various MPI blocking
    * collective operations (MPI_Allgather, MPI_Alltoall, MPI_Allreduce,
    * MPI_Barrier, MPI_Bcast, MPI_Gather, MPI_Reduce, MPI_Reduce_Scatter,
    * MPI_Scatter and vector collectives). These benchmarks work in the
    * following manner.  Suppose users run the osu_bcast benchmark with N
    * processes, the benchmark measures the min, max and the average latency of
    * the MPI_Bcast collective operation across N processes, for various
    * message lengths, over a large number of iterations. In the default
    * version, these benchmarks report the average latency for each message
    * length. Additionally, the benchmarks offer the following options:
    * "-f" can be used to report additional statistics of the benchmark,
           such as min and max latencies and the number of iterations.
    * "-m" option can be used to set the minimum and maximum message length
           to be used in a benchmark. In the default version, the benchmarks
           report the latencies for up to 1MB message lengths. Examples:
            -m 128      // min = default, max = 128
            -m 2:128    // min = 2, max = 128
            -m 2:       // min = 2, max = default
    * "-x" can be used to set the number of warmup iterations to skip for each
           message length.
    * "-i" can be used to set the number of iterations to run for each message
           length.
    * "-M" can be used to set per process maximum memory consumption.  By
           default the benchmarks are limited to 512MB allocations.


Support for CUDA Managed Memory
---------------------------------
The following benchmarks have been extended to evaluate performance of MPI communication
from and to buffers allocated using CUDA Managed Memory.

    * osu_bibw - Bidirectional Bandwidth Test
    * osu_bw - Bandwidth Test
    * osu_latency - Latency Test
    * osu_allgather - MPI_Allgather Latency Test
    * osu_allgatherv - MPI_Allgatherv Latency Test
    * osu_allreduce - MPI_Allreduce Latency Test
    * osu_alltoall - MPI_Alltoall Latency Test
    * osu_alltoallv - MPI_Alltoallv Latency Test
    * osu_bcast - MPI_Bcast Latency Test
    * osu_gather - MPI_Gather Latency Test
    * osu_gatherv - MPI_Gatherv Latency Test
    * osu_reduce - MPI_Reduce Latency Test
    * osu_reduce_scatter - MPI_Reduce_scatter Latency Test
    * osu_scatter - MPI_Scatter Latency Test
    * osu_scatterv - MPI_Scatterv Latency Test

In addition to support for communications to and from GPU memories allocated
using CUDA or OpenACC, we now provide additional capability of performing
communications to and from buffers allocated using the CUDA Managed Memory concept.
CUDA Managed (or Unified) Memory allows applications to allocate memory on either CPU
or GPU memories using the cudaMallocManaged() call. This allows user oblivious transfer
of the memory buffer between the CPU or GPU. Currently, we offer benchmarking with CUDA
Managed Memory using the tests mentioned above.

These benchmarks have additional options:
    * "M" allocates a send or receive buffer as managed for point to point communication.
    * "-d managed" uses managed memory buffers to perform collective communications.

Non-Blocking Collective Latency Tests
    * In addition to the blocking collective latency tests, we provide several
    * non-blocking collectives as mentioned above. These evaluate the same
    * metrics as the blocking operations as well as the additional metric
    * `overlap'.  This is defined as the amount of computation that can be
    * performed while the communication progresses in the background.
    * These benchmarks have the additional option:
    * "-t" set the number of MPI_Test() calls during the dummy computation, set
           CALLS to 100, 1000, or any number > 0.


One-sided MPI Benchmarks

    * MPI_Win_flush_local, MPI_Win_lock_all/unlock_all,
    * MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait and MPI_Win_fence). For active
    * synchronization, suppose users run with MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait,
    * the origin process calls MPI_Put to directly place data of a certain size
    * in the remote process's window and then waiting on a synchronization call

    * iterations of this test is carried out and the average put latency
    * numbers is reported. The latency includes the synchronization time also.
    * For passive synchronization, suppose users run with MPI_Win_lock/unlock,
    * the origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the target process's window
    * and calls MPI_Put to directly place data of certain size in the window.
    * Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure completion of the Put and release
    * lock on the window. This is carried out for several iterations and the
    * average time for MPI_Lock + MPI_Put + MPI_Unlock calls is measured. The
    * default window initialization and synchronization operations are
    * MPI_Win_allocate and MPI_Win_flush. The benchmark offers the following
    * options:

    * "-x"              can be used to set the number of warmup iterations to
                        skip for each message length.
    * "-i"              can be used to set the number of iterations to run for
                        each message length.

osu_get_latency - Latency Test for Get with Active/Passive Synchronization
    * The get latency benchmark includes window initialization operations

    * MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait and MPI_Win_fence). For active
    * synchronization, suppose users run with MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait,
    * the origin process calls MPI_Get to directly fetch data of a certain size
    * from the target process's window into a local buffer. It then waits on a
    * synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for local completion of the Gets.
    * The remote process participates in synchronization with MPI_Win_post and
    * MPI_Win_wait calls. Several iterations of this test is carried out and

    * with MPI_Win_lock/unlock, the origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock
    * the target process's window and calls MPI_Get to directly read data of
    * certain size from the window. Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure
    * completion of the Get and releases lock on remote window. This is carried
    * out for several iterations and the average time for MPI_Lock + MPI_Get +
    * MPI_Unlock calls is measured.  The default window initialization and

    * the window. This is carried out for several iterations and the average
    * time for MPI_Compare_and_swap + MPI_Win_flush calls is measured. The
    * default window initialization and synchronization operations are
    * MPI_Win_allocate and MPI_Win_flush. The benchmark offers the following
    * options:

    * MPI_Win_flush_local, MPI_Win_lock_all/unlock_all,
    * MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait and MPI_Win_fence). For active
    * synchronization, suppose users run with MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait,
    * the origin process calls MPI_Get_accumulate to combine data from the

Point-to-Point OpenSHMEM Benchmarks
-----------------------------------
osu_oshm_put.c - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Put Routine
    * This benchmark measures latency of a shmem putmem operation for different
    * data sizes. The user is required to select whether the communication
    * buffers should be allocated in global memory or heap memory, through a
    * parameter. The test requires exactly two PEs. PE 0 issues shmem putmem to
    * write data at PE 1 and then calls shmem quiet. This is repeated for a
    * fixed number of iterations, depending on the data size. The average
    * latency per iteration is reported. A few warm-up iterations are run
    * without timing to ignore any start-up overheads.  Both PEs call shmem
    * barrier all after the test for each message size.

osu_oshm_get.c - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Get Routine
    * This benchmark is similar to the one above except that PE 0 does a shmem
    * getmem operation to read data from PE 1 in each iteration. The average
    * latency per iteration is reported.

osu_oshm_put_mr.c - Message Rate Test for OpenSHMEM Put Routine
    * This benchmark measures the aggregate uni-directional operation rate of
    * OpenSHMEM Put between pairs of PEs, for different data sizes. The user
    * should select for communication buffers to be in global memory and heap
    * memory as with the earlier benchmarks. This test requires number of PEs
    * to be even. The PEs are paired with PE 0 pairing with PE n/2 and so on,
    * where n is the total number of PEs. The first PE in each pair issues
    * back-to-back shmem putmem operations to its peer PE. The total time for
    * the put operations is measured and operation rate per second is reported.
    * All PEs call shmem barrier all after the test for each message size.

osu_oshm_atomics.c - Latency and Operation Rate Test for OpenSHMEM Atomics Routines
    * This benchmark measures the performance of atomic fetch-and-operate and
    * atomic operate routines sup- ported in OpenSHMEM for the integer
    * datatype. The buffers can be selected to be in heap memory or global
    * memory. The PEs are paired like in the case of Put Operation Rate
    * benchmark and the first PE in each pair issues back-to-back atomic
    * operations of a type to its peer PE. The average latency per atomic
    * operation and the aggregate operation rate are reported.  This is
    * repeated for each of fadd, finc, add, inc, cswap and swap routines.

           such as min and max latencies and the number of iterations.
    * "-m" option can be used to set the maximum message length to be used in a
           benchmark. In the default version, the benchmarks report the

    * MPI_Finalize.
    *
    * Example:
    * - time mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile osu_hello

CUDA and OpenACC Extensions to OMB
----------------------------------
CUDA Extensions to OMB can be enable by configuring the benchmark suite with
--enable-cuda option as shown below.  Similarly, OpenACC Extensions can be
enabled by specifying the --enable-openacc option.  The MPI library used should
be able to support MPI communication from buffers in GPU Device memory.

    ./configure CC=/path/to/mpicc 
                CXX=/path/to/mpicxx
                --enable-cuda 
                --with-cuda-include=/path/to/cuda/include
                --with-cuda-libpath=/path/to/cuda/lib
    make
    make install

If both CUDA and OpenACC support is enabled you can switch between the modes
using the -d [cuda|openacc] option to the benchmarks.  Whether a process
allocates its communication buffers on the GPU device or on the host can be
controlled at run-time.  Use the -h option for more help.

    ./osu_latency -h
    Usage: osu_latency [options] [RANK0 RANK1]

    RANK0 and RANK1 may be `D' or `H' which specifies whether
    the buffer is allocated on the accelerator device or host
    memory for each mpi rank

    options:
      -d TYPE   accelerator device buffers can be of TYPE `cuda' or `openac'
      -h        print this help message

Each of the pt2pt benchmarks takes two input parameters. The first parameter
indicates the location of the buffers at rank 0 and the second parameter
indicates the location of the buffers at rank 1. The value of each of these
parameters can be either 'H' or 'D' to indicate if the buffers are to be on the
host or on the device respectively. When no parameters are specified, the
buffers are allocated on the host.  The collective benchmarks will use buffers
allocated on the device if the -d option is used otherwise the buffers will be
allocated on the host.

Examples:

    - mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile MV2_USE_CUDA=1 osu_latency D D

In this run, the latency test allocates buffers at both rank 0 and rank 1 on
the GPU devices.

    - mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile MV2_USE_CUDA=1 osu_bw D H

In this run, the bandwidth test allocates buffers at rank 0 on the GPU device
and buffers at rank 1 on the host.

Setting GPU affinity
--------------------
GPU affinity for processes is set before MPI_Init is called in the benchmarks.
The process rank on a node is normally used to do this and different MPI
launchers expose this information through different environment variables. The
benchmarks use an environment variable called LOCAL_RANK to get this
information.

A script like below can be used to export this environment variable when using
mpirun_rsh.  This can be adapted to work with other MPI launchers and
libraries.

    #!/bin/bash

    export LOCAL_RANK=$MV2_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK
    exec $*

A copy of this script is installed as get_local_rank alongside the benchmarks.
It can be used as follows:

    mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile MV2_USE_CUDA=1 get_local_rank \
        ./osu_latency D D
