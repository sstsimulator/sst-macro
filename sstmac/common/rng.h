 A lagged Fibonacci random number generator by George Marsaglia

 <i>LFIB4 is an extension of the class that I have previously
 defined as lagged Fibonacci generators: x(n)=x(n-r) op x(n-s),
 with the x's in a finite set over which there is a binary
 operation op, such as +,- on integers mod 232, * on odd such
 integers, exclusive-or (xor) on binary vectors. Except for
 those using multiplication, lagged Fibonacci generators fail
 various tests of randomness, unless the lags are very long.  To
 see if more than two lags would serve to overcome the problems
 of 2- lag generators using +,- or xor, I have developed the
 4-lag generator LFIB4: x(n)=x(n-256)+x(n-179)+x(n-119)+x(n-55)
 mod 232.  Its period is 2<sup>31</sup>*(2<sup>256</sup>-1), about 2<sup>287</sup>, and it seems
 to pass all tests---in particular, those of the kind for which
 2-lag generators using +,-,xor seem to fail.  For even more
 confidence in its suitability, LFIB4 can be combined with KISS,
 with a resulting period of about 2<sup>410</sup>: just use (KISS+LFIB4) in
 any C expression.</i>
